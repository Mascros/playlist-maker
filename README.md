# Playlist Maker [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Mascros/playlist-maker/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Mascros/playlist-maker)
A new and improved version of the site I made for my A Level computing project but (hopefully) better.

Users sign in with their spotify account, choose some freinds, and the site will create a playlist based on the groups music tastes.
