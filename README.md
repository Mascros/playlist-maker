# Playlist Maker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RobinStephenson/playlist-maker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RobinStephenson/playlist-maker)
A new and improved version of the site I made for my A Level computing project but (hopefully) better.

Users sign in with their spotify account, choose some freinds, and the site will create a playlist based on the groups music tastes.
